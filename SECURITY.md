# Security Guide for Open Source Deployment

This guide covers security considerations for deploying the mentorship platform as an open-source project.

## Environment Variables

The application requires these environment variables. **Never commit actual values to the repository.**

### Required Environment Variables

```bash
# Database Configuration
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@host:port/database_name

# Session Security
SESSION_SECRET=your-random-secret-key-here

# PostgreSQL Connection Details (if using separate variables)
PGHOST=your-db-host
PGPORT=5432
PGUSER=your-db-user
PGPASSWORD=your-db-password
PGDATABASE=your-db-name
```

### Environment Setup

1. **For Local Development:**
   - Create a `.env` file (already in .gitignore)
   - Copy `.env.example` template if provided
   - Never commit `.env` files

2. **For Production:**
   - Set environment variables through your hosting platform
   - Use secure secret management services
   - Rotate secrets regularly

## Security Checklist

### Before Making Repository Public

- [ ] Remove any hardcoded credentials from code
- [ ] Ensure `.gitignore` covers all sensitive files
- [ ] Review commit history for accidentally committed secrets
- [ ] Remove any personal information from comments
- [ ] Clear any local database files

### Database Security

- [ ] Use strong, unique database passwords
- [ ] Enable SSL/TLS for database connections
- [ ] Implement database user with minimal required permissions
- [ ] Regular database backups with encryption
- [ ] Monitor database access logs

### Application Security

- [ ] Use strong, randomly generated SESSION_SECRET
- [ ] Implement rate limiting for form submissions
- [ ] Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- [ ] Use HTTPS in production (handled by deployment platform)
- [ ] Implement proper error handling (no sensitive info in errors)

### Access Control

- [ ] Review admin user creation process
- [ ] Implement proper authentication flows
- [ ] Ensure role-based access controls are working
- [ ] Test permission boundaries

## Deployment Recommendations

### Hosting Platforms

**Recommended platforms for open-source projects:**

1. **Replit Deployments**
   - Built-in secret management
   - Easy PostgreSQL integration
   - Automatic HTTPS

2. **Railway**
   - Free tier for open source
   - Built-in PostgreSQL
   - Environment variable management

3. **Render**
   - Free tier available
   - Managed PostgreSQL
   - Automatic deployments

### Environment Variable Management

**Never do this:**
```python
# DON'T hardcode secrets
DATABASE_URL = "postgresql://user:pass@host/db"
SESSION_SECRET = "mysecret"
```

**Always do this:**
```python
# Use environment variables
DATABASE_URL = os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL")
SESSION_SECRET = os.environ.get("SESSION_SECRET")
```

## Open Source Considerations

### License

Add an appropriate open-source license:
- MIT License (permissive)
- GNU GPL v3 (copyleft)
- Apache License 2.0 (permissive with patent protection)

### Documentation

Provide clear documentation for:
- Installation instructions
- Environment setup
- Configuration options
- API endpoints (if any)
- Contributing guidelines

### Community Guidelines

Consider adding:
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - How to contribute
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` - Community standards
- Issue templates
- Pull request templates

## Data Privacy

### User Data Protection

- Implement data minimization principles
- Provide clear privacy policies
- Allow users to export/delete their data
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- Use secure password hashing (already implemented with Werkzeug)

### Compliance Considerations

For organizations deploying this platform:
- GDPR compliance (if serving EU users)
- CCPA compliance (if serving California users)
- Industry-specific regulations
- Internal data handling policies

## Monitoring and Logging

### Security Monitoring

Implement logging for:
- Authentication attempts
- Admin actions
- Form submissions
- Database access
- Error conditions

### Log Security

- Don't log sensitive information
- Encrypt log files
- Implement log rotation
- Monitor for suspicious patterns

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Plan

1. **Detection** - Monitor for security issues
2. **Assessment** - Evaluate impact and scope
3. **Containment** - Isolate affected systems
4. **Recovery** - Restore normal operations
5. **Lessons Learned** - Document and improve

### Contact Information

For security issues:
- Create a security contact email
- Consider a bug bounty program
- Provide clear reporting procedures

## Regular Security Maintenance

### Updates

- Keep dependencies updated
- Monitor security advisories
- Apply security patches promptly
- Test updates in staging environment

### Security Reviews

- Code reviews for security issues
- Penetration testing (for production)
- Access control audits
- Security configuration reviews

**Remember:** Security is an ongoing process, not a one-time setup. Regular reviews and updates are essential for maintaining a secure application.
